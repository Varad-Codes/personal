      <p>My Love</p>
      <p>
        I was planning to write this as a physical letter in reply to the ones
        you’ve given me, but since it’s your birthday, I thought I’d make it a
        little present instead—it's the least I can do (plus, I needed an excuse
        to write a bit of code, haha). To start off, I never thought I’d be with
        someone again, but after meeting you, I can't imagine being with anyone
        else. We may not have everything figured out, but we’ve got time, and
        I’m confident we will. I know I’m not the best at expressing myself or
        communicating, but we’ll figure that out too. Let’s figure life out
        together and turn this beautiful mess into our own masterpiece. There’s
        a lot more I wanted to say, but I’ll save it for another day. I love
        you, Aanya. Happy birthday!
